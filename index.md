### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1 was a favorite because I have always been fascinated by the patterns of knitted sweaters. It was interesting to be able to create a simple pattern even if it was not an accurate pattern for knitting. In addition, I was able to get an idea of how machines make these knitted patterns. I learned how to create a nested loop to make a simple pattern comparable to a knitted pattern.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, Part 3 was a favorite because I like ombre and gradient images and have been curious about how those images are made so that it appears to blend seamlessly on a digital screen. I learned how to use GraphicsMagick functions to create colored images. As well as create a function and strings to make certain that the image format comes out as a PNG only.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 1 was a favorite because animations are entertaining to look at, so being able to create one was exciting. I was also curious about how to create a program to make images appear like they are moving. It was exciting being able to create my first animation. I learned how math functions are incorporated into programming images like these, so the animation flows seamlessly.
